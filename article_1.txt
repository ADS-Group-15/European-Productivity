<h2 style="text-align:center;">Statistical Visualisation and Analysis of the Impact to the Labour Productivity in EU Countries Brought by Different Factors</h2><p style="text-align:center;">Kentaro Takiguchi, Yifan Tang, Yuchi Liu, Zijie Liang, Si Chen, Chang Zhao</p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4><p>The Eurostat provides labour productivity of most EU countries every year, which is a critical indicator measuring national economic condition. In this report, using other datasets containing different factors, we developed a visualization framework to view the data and explore potential factors that might influence the trends of productivity. Then we trained a linear regression model and a non-linear GBDT model to further analyzing the dataset, and found that the number of people engaged with science and technology is the most informative indicator.</p><h3>1 &nbsp;Introduction</h3><p>The current era is an era of peaceful development. Countries around the world are constantly improving their overall strength, so that people in the country can live a happier life. Increasing domestic productivity is an important way to enhance the country’s overall strength. How to quickly increase GDP is a problem that leaders of every country want to solve.</p><p>Many scientists have studied which factors will affect GDP. C. Caraiani, C.I. Lungu and C. Dasca˘lu <a href="#_bookmark13"><span style="color:windowtext;">[2] </span></a>have studied the causal relationship between primary energy consumption and economic growth in the five emerging countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Turkey) from 1980 to 2013, and drew a conclusion that for most major energy sources In general, there is insufficient evidence to determine the possible impact on the economic growth of emerging European countries. Adne Cappelen, Nils Petter Gleditsch and Olav Bjerkholt <a href="#_bookmark20"><span style="color:windowtext;">[9] </span></a>describe the impact of military expenditures on investment based on data from 17 OECD countries from 1960 to 1980. The results show that, except for Mediterranean countries, the entire sample has a negative impact on economic growth. Adriana Di <a href="#_bookmark18"><span style="color:windowtext;">Liberto[7] </span></a>investigate the impact of Italian primary and higher education on economic development. The results show that the development of primary education in the 1960s had a positive impact on the Italian economy, but the effect of higher education was not obvious or even negative.</p><p>In this paper, our aim is to find the main factors related to labor productivity, establish a variety of models to find the relationship between these factors and productivity, and realize prediction, so as to draw conclusions which factors have a greater impact on labor productivity. In addition, we will design a website to display all the data obtained and calculated using visual methods.</p><p>In terms of data selection, important factors affecting a country’s productivity are education, science and technology, trade, and population. Therefore, in this paper, we selected 7 kinds of data in these fields for analysis.</p><p>In this project, Section 3 will talk about Data Preparation, how the obtained data is preprocessed. Section 4 talks about Data Exploration, building a visualization framework, in depth analysis of several data. Section 5 is about Data Modeling, which uses different methods to process data and make a prediction; Section 6 draws conclusions based on experimental results.</p><h3>2 &nbsp;Data Preparation</h3><p>The data analysed in the present study is published by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, which is responsible for harmonising and archiving the statistics data from the European statistical system (ESS) <a href="#_bookmark16"><span style="color:windowtext;">[5].</span></a> According to their document, a regulation called The European Statistics Code of Practice is adopted to guarantee that the statistics produced are updated reliably and punctually <a href="#_bookmark15"><span style="color:windowtext;">[4].</span></a> The whole data set consists of the Labour Productivity (per person), Work Compensation (per person and per hour worked), Participation Rate in Education, Population, Research and Experimental Development (R&amp;D) Expenditure, Fertility Rate, Human Resources in Science and Technology (HRST), Tax Rate, and International Trade of each year from 2010 to 2019 of the following 34 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxem-bourg, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. All of the datasets can be downloaded as CSV file from Eurostat website. In order to store and visualize these data We choose MySQL database to keep these data, build a website to represent these data in varies kind of charts and add interactive feathers for charts, which helps us a lot for data exploration.</p><h4>2.1 &nbsp;Data Wrangling</h4><p>After choosing the full dataset and downloading them, we found that the raw data retrieved was not reaching the basic requirement of performing analysis.</p><p>First, the data completeness is different, Fertility Rate and R\&amp;D Expenditure lack the data in 2019. Moreover, many countries lack their data in certain fields, for example, Belarus didn’t provided the Participation rate in education and training.</p><p>Second, some data unit is inconvenient for analyzing directly due to the number is too big to find evident features.</p><p>Third, some entries are inappropriate for analyzing. For example, in the raw data file of labour productivity, some entries reflecting the data of the entire European Union will cause some problem when we analyze the independent data of each country.</p><p>So we have to do data wrangling (also known as “data munging”) including further filtering and aggregation of data allowed us to transform or parse the raw data into a more comprehensive format or a predefined structure to improve the efficiency of downstream analysis <a href="#_bookmark14"><span style="color:windowtext;">[3].</span></a> Table 1 illustrates the data from 8 different sources aggregated together to present a more intuitive outlook and improve the efficiency of analysis. Then we choose to focus our analysis on the countries that provide their data for all the dataset we need. Similarly, we eliminated data in 2019 because some datasets didn’t provide them. For different objective of analysis, we also temporarily choose to remove the data reflecting the condition of entire European country. For&nbsp; the data unit, we switch the unit of population from person to thousand people. There is also an issue about the data quality, the consistency of the data is doubtful. Some data break in statistical time series, which means there is a change in the standards for defining and observing a variable over time. We choose to ignore this change and utilize the data directly.</p><figure class="table"><table style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><tbody><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">GEO</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">LPPP(%) 1</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">CEPH(EUR) 2</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">PRE(%) 3</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">POP(K) 4</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">FR(%) 5</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">R&amp;D(%) 6</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">HRST(%) 7</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">TR(%) 8</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">IT(MEUR) 9</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>BE</strong></td><td>104.4</td><td>39.1</td><td>15.9</td><td>11,398.59</td><td>1.62131</td><td>2.76</td><td>54.40</td><td>20.13</td><td>11,640.80</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>FR</strong></td><td>105.8</td><td>34.7</td><td>24.2</td><td>66,918.94</td><td>1.87655</td><td>2.20</td><td>52.20</td><td>15.68</td><td>-75,755.70</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>DE</strong></td><td>105.8</td><td>32.6</td><td>14.9</td><td>82,792.35</td><td>1.56558</td><td>3.13</td><td>49.30</td><td>31.12</td><td>23,301.10</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>IT</strong></td><td>97.8</td><td>23.1</td><td>13.3</td><td>60,483.97</td><td>1.28968</td><td>1.39</td><td>37.00</td><td>16.15</td><td>39,279.70</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>NL</strong></td><td>104.9</td><td>34.6</td><td>26.7</td><td>17,181.08</td><td>1.58618</td><td>2.16</td><td>56.90</td><td>15.97</td><td>68,773.90</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>PO</strong></td><td>129.4</td><td>7.5</td><td>11.7</td><td>37,976.69</td><td>1.45845</td><td>1.21</td><td>45.20</td><td>23.75</td><td>-4,583.20</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>UK</strong></td><td>105.1</td><td>26.1</td><td>18.9</td><td>66,273.58</td><td>1.67629</td><td>1.70</td><td>57.60</td><td>14.89</td><td>-158,491.30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>1 Real labour productivity per person employed (annual) - (index, 2010=100%)</p><p>2 Compensation of employees per hour worked - (EUR)</p><p>3 Participation rate in education and training (last 4 weeks) by all gender, 18-64 years and all ISCED 2011 levels - (percentage)</p><p>4 Population in a country on 1 January of the respective year - (thousands people)</p><p>5 Fertility rates by total age class - (percentage)</p><p>6 Gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) - (percentage of GDP)</p><p>7 Human resources in science and technology (HRST) - (percentage of active population)</p><p>8 Tax rate among single person without children, 50% of AW - (percentage)</p><p>9 International trade, by reporting country, total product - (Million EUR)</p><p style="text-align:center;">Table 1: Partial Aggregated Data of Countries in 2018</p><h3>3 &nbsp;Data Exploration</h3><p>To find out possible factors that might have potential affections on the productivity among EU countries, we explored the prepared data in several aspects.
