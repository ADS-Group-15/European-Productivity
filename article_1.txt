<h2 style="text-align:center;">Statistical Visualisation and Analysis of the Impact to the Labour Productivity in EU Countries Brought by Different Factors</h2><p style="text-align:center;">Kentaro Takiguchi, Yifan Tang, Yuchi Liu, Zijie Liang, Si Chen, Chang Zhao</p><h4>ABSTRACT</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">The Eurostat provides labour productivity of most EU countries from 2010 to 2019, which is a critical indicator measuring national economic condition. And our task is to find the factors that influence the variation tendency of labour productivity. In this report, datasets containing different factors were drawn from Eurostat. In the data wrangling process, the data was filtered and aggregated to get the information necessary for exploration. Then in data exploration part, a visualization framework was developed to provide various diagrams of the data that help to investigate potential factors influencing the trends of productivity. Moreover, in the modeling part, a linear regression model and a non-linear GBDT model were trained with different factors to further analyze the datasets, and some prediction works were also achieved along with an explanation of the result using SHAP. Finally, the HRST and Gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D are the most informative indicator that impacts labour productivity.</p><h3 style="text-align:justify;">1 &nbsp;Introduction</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Labour productivity has been an important metric to measure the growth of countries. Many aspects such as the development level of Labour productivity has been an important metric to measure the growth of countries. Many aspects such as the development level of economics, average education level, happiness, etc., are influenced by labour productivity. Hence, labour productivity can be an indicator of the development of a country and be used as a reference for adjusting policy or/and welfare by governments of different countries. Therefore, a model of labour productivity is necessary and how to model the labour productivity in suitable ways hence make reasonable predictions become a challenge.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Many researchers have studied factors that affect GDP. For example, C. Caraiani, C.I. Lungu and C. Dasca˘lu [2] have studied the causal relationship between primary energy consumption and economic growth in the five emerging countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Turkey) from 1980 to 2013, and drew a conclusion that for most major energy sources, no sufficient evidence support that primary energy consumption determines the possible impact on the economic growth of emerging European countries. Moreover, research by Adne Cappelen[9] describes the impact of military expenditures on investment based on data from 17 OECD countries from 1960 to 1980. The results show that, except for Mediterranean countries, the entire sample has a negative impact on economic growth. Adriana Di Liberto[7] investigates the impact of Italian primary and higher education on economic development. They find that the development of primary education in the 1960s had a positive impact on the Italian economy, but the effect of higher education was not obvious or even negative.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All of these researches mentioned above focus on one or a few factors, which is hard to get an overall image of factors that influences economics.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In this project, the main aim is to give an as comprehensive as possible and quantitative measurement of factors influencing the labour productivity, which combines factors that studied by other researchers mentioned above as well as extra possible factors whose data can be retrieved from Eurostat. Establish various models to find the relationship between these factors and productivity and provide reasonable predictions, so as to draw conclusions which factors have a greater impact on labor productivity. In addition, we will design a web framework to visualize data in different ways that help the analysis of data. In addition, in order&nbsp;to illustrate our data visualization work, we published our report combined with interactive charts at here.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In this report, we introduce three parts of the work we have done. The first is data preparation, which includes the introduction of datasets we used in further work and the wrangling process of these datasets.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Then in the data exploration part, a visualization framework is introduced and different methods like correlation coefficient are applied on various datasets to figure out the weight of the relationship between chosen dataset and labour productivity. Factors such as education, science and technology, trade, and population that may affect a country’s productivity have been explored in this part of work.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The last work we do is data modeling, in order to find out the suitable way to model labour productivity and produce reasonable predictions. Different approaches were explored to process data and make predictions. Finally, we provided the explanation of prediction results and draws conclusions based on these results.</p><h3>2 &nbsp;Data Preparation</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">The data analyzed in the present study is published by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, which is responsible for harmonizing and archiving the statistics data from the European statistical system (ESS) [5]. According to their document, a regulation called The European Statistics Code of Practice is adopted to guarantee that the statistics produced are updated reliably and punctually [4]. The whole data set consists of the Labour Productivity (per person), Work Compensation (per person and per hour worked), Participation Rate in Education, Population, Research, and Experimental Development (R&amp;D) Expenditure, Fertility Rate, Human Resources in Science and Technology (HRST), Tax Rate, and International Trade of each year from 2010 to 2019 of the following 34 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. All of the datasets can be downloaded as CSV files from Eurostat website. In order to store and visualize these data. We choose MySQL database to keep these data, build a website to represent these data in various types of charts, and add interactive feathers for charts, which helps us a lot for data exploration.</p><h4>2.1 &nbsp;Data Wrangling</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">After choosing the full dataset and downloading them, we found that the raw data retrieved was not reaching the basic requirement of performing analysis.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">The data completeness is different, Fertility Rate and R&amp;D Expenditure lack the data in 2019. Moreover, many countries lack their data in certain fields, for example, Belarus did not provide the Participation rate in education and training.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Several data unit is inconvenient for analyzing directly due to the number is too big to find evident features.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Some entries are inappropriate for analyzing. For ex- ample, in the raw data file of labour productivity, some entries reflecting the data of the entire European Union will cause some problems when we analyze the independent data of each country.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">So we have to do data wrangling (also known as “data munging”) including further filtering and aggregation of data allowed us to transform or parse the raw data into a more comprehensive format or a predefined structure to improve the efficiency of downstream analysis [3]. Table 1 illustrates the data from 8 different sources aggregated together to present a more intuitive outlook and improve the efficiency of analysis. Then we choose to focus our analysis on the countries that provide their data for all the dataset we need. Similarly, we eliminated data in 2019 because some datasets did not provide them. For the different objectives of the analysis, we also temporarily choose to remove the data reflecting the condition of the entire European country. For the data unit, we switch the unit of the population from person to thousands of people. There is also an issue about the data quality, the consistency of the data is doubtful. Some data break-in statistical time series, which means there is a change in the standards for defining and observing a variable over time. We choose to ignore this change and utilize the data directly.</p><figure class="table"><table style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><tbody><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">GEO</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">LPPP(%) 1</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">CEPH(EUR) 2</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">PRE(%) 3</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">POP(K) 4</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">FR(%) 5</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">R&amp;D(%) 6</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">HRST(%) 7</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">TR(%) 8</td><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;">IT(MEUR) 9</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>BE</strong></td><td>104.4</td><td>39.1</td><td>15.9</td><td>11,398.59</td><td>1.62131</td><td>2.76</td><td>54.40</td><td>20.13</td><td>11,640.80</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>FR</strong></td><td>105.8</td><td>34.7</td><td>24.2</td><td>66,918.94</td><td>1.87655</td><td>2.20</td><td>52.20</td><td>15.68</td><td>-75,755.70</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>DE</strong></td><td>105.8</td><td>32.6</td><td>14.9</td><td>82,792.35</td><td>1.56558</td><td>3.13</td><td>49.30</td><td>31.12</td><td>23,301.10</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>IT</strong></td><td>97.8</td><td>23.1</td><td>13.3</td><td>60,483.97</td><td>1.28968</td><td>1.39</td><td>37.00</td><td>16.15</td><td>39,279.70</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>NL</strong></td><td>104.9</td><td>34.6</td><td>26.7</td><td>17,181.08</td><td>1.58618</td><td>2.16</td><td>56.90</td><td>15.97</td><td>68,773.90</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>PO</strong></td><td>129.4</td><td>7.5</td><td>11.7</td><td>37,976.69</td><td>1.45845</td><td>1.21</td><td>45.20</td><td>23.75</td><td>-4,583.20</td></tr><tr><td style="border-bottom:groove;border-left:groove;border-right:groove;border-top:groove;"><strong>UK</strong></td><td>105.1</td><td>26.1</td><td>18.9</td><td>66,273.58</td><td>1.67629</td><td>1.70</td><td>57.60</td><td>14.89</td><td>-158,491.30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>1 Real labour productivity per person employed (annual) - (index, 2010=100%)</p><p>2 Compensation of employees per hour worked - (EUR)</p><p>3 Participation rate in education and training (last 4 weeks) by all gender, 18-64 years and all ISCED 2011 levels - (percentage)</p><p>4 Population in a country on 1 January of the respective year - (thousands people)</p><p>5 Fertility rates by total age class - (percentage)</p><p>6 Gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) - (percentage of GDP)</p><p>7 Human resources in science and technology (HRST) - (percentage of active population)</p><p>8 Tax rate among single person without children, 50% of AW - (percentage)</p><p>9 International trade, by reporting country, total product - (Million EUR)</p><p style="text-align:center;">Table 1: Partial Aggregated Data of Countries in 2018</p><h3>3 &nbsp;Data Exploration</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">To find out possible factors that might have potential affections on the productivity of EU countries, we explored the prepared data in several aspects.
